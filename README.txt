If you are uninterested by the source code and would just like to try the code. Install the 'game' branch instead.

To run the game, open the file named 'RPG.py' and run it. The other files allow the game to run. Ensure the 'RPG.py' file is run from within the folder.
This game requires the use of Python version 3.10 or later because of the use of match case statements.
Ensure that Python 3.10 or later is installed before trying to play.

If you encounter any issues, bugs or things you don't think should be happening. Please leave a comment on the GitHub page. 
If you have any ideas for the game, excluding additionial missions after mission 10, leave a comment on the GitHub page.

Future Ideas:
-Adjust enemy amounts in missions. Potentially, new enemy.
-More riddles for the witch.
-Character and enemy encyclopeadia.
